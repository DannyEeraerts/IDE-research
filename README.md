## What is an IDE
	
An **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment (IDE) is **a software suite that consolidates basic tools required to write and test software.**

### Why to use an IDE

Developers use numerous tools throughout software code creation, building and testing. Development tools often include text editors, code libraries, compilers and test platforms. Without an IDE, a developer must *select*, *deploy*, *integrate* and manage all of these tools separately. **An IDE brings many of those development-related tools together as a single framework, application or service.** The integrated toolset is **designed to simplify software development** and can *identify* and *minimize coding mistakes and typos*.

Some IDEs are open source, while others are commercial offerings. An IDE can be a standalone application or it can be part of a larger package.

### Common features of integrated development environments

An IDE typically contains **a code editor, a compiler or interpreter, and a debugger** , accessed through a single graphical user interface (GUI). The user writes and edits *source code* in the code editor. The *compiler* translates the source code into a readable language that is executable for a computer. And the *debugger* tests the software to solve any issues or bugs.

An IDE can also contain features such as programmable editors, object and data modeling, unit testing, a source code library and build automation tools.

An IDE's toolbar looks much like a word processor's toolbar. The toolbar facilitates color-based organization, source-code formatting, error diagnostics and reporting, and intelligent code completion. Through an IDE's interface, a developer or team of developers can compile and execute code incrementally and manage changes to source code in a uniform manner. IDEs are typically designed to integrate with third-party version control libraries, such as GitHub and Apache's Subversion.

### Benefits of using IDEs

An IDE can **improve the productivity of software developers thanks to fast setup and standardization across tools.**

IDEs are also designed with all their tools under one user interface. An IDE **can standardize the development process** by organizing the necessary features for software development in the UI.

### Types of IDEs and available tools

Developers **must match the IDE they use with the type of application they want to produce.** For example, if a developer wants to create an application on iOS, then they need an IDE that supports Apple's Swift programming language. Types of IDEs range from web-based and cloud-based to mobile, language-specific or multi-language.

## Comparision PHPStorm vs Visual Studio Code.

| 	        | PHPStorm      | VisualStudioCode  |
| ------------- |:-------------| :-----------------|
| **Pro's** 	| 1. Powerfull autocomplet and code check | 1. Free             |
| 	        | 2. Regular updates for fixes and new features     | 2. Beginner friendly  |
| 	        | 3. Lots of plugins    | 3. More plug-ins  |
| **Con's**     | 1. Price     |   1. Generalized     |
| 	        | 2. Debugging is not so easy      | 2. Project search limits result  |
| 	        | 3. Interface is cluttered      | 3. Sometimes the autocomplete and code check is not as powerfull as PHPStorm  |
